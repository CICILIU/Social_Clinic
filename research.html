            <h3>Phubbing</h3>
            <p>Phubbing is a term coined as part of a campaign by Macquarie Dictionary to describe the habit of snubbing someone in favour of a mobile phone. In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign - McCann Melbourne - invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a neologism to describe the behaviour. The term has appeared in media around the world, and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann.</p>

    		<h3>Social Awkwardness</h3>
            <p>The social interactions of socially awkward adults  tend to be immature and complex, even though their nonrelational reasoning ranges from normal to gifted. They exhibit varying degrees of social awkwardness and various types of nonverbal communication difficulties. Some might only have trouble with reception or expression alone, while others struggle with both. Severity fluctuates among individuals; difficulty does not necessarily equate to total inability, nor occur in all situations. Occasionally, expressive difficulty may only be a delay between the emotion and the facial muscles. Socially awkward adults suffering from nonverbal shortcomings often report feeling "a little out of it socially" or feeling "left out." There is always a danger that over time, these frustrations could exacerbate a sense of grief and despair. Socially awkward adults frequently experience success in temporary or accidental situations, but their sense of success can be short-lived, returning to an often common pattern of disappointment and self-reproach. Many times Socially awkward individuals may say something in a way they had not intended and worry about the consequences. </p>
